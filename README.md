# RomanNumeralConverter

Command line program for converting roman numerals to standard characters and vice versa.  

Run with flag -r followed by files with Roman numerals to convert characters to standard.

Run with flag -s followed by files with standard numbers to convert them to roman numerals.

Run the executable by itself to input characters and numbers manually.

I spent about 2 hours on the program.
